Welcome to Documatic. 

When you want to generate a Sequence for Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, here is what to do:

-First, go to 

http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/downloads/

and download and install the package for your operating system (This just allows documatic to pre-edit footage from a variety of different codecs)


-Next, copy a project folder to your computer (Your project are all stored on your phone's SD card in a folder called, "Documatic"

-Copy all the recorded video files into the folder called "video"

-Double click the file named "Generate_Project.jar"

-Drag the generated project file ("PROJECTNAME_Pre_Edit") into Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro




********************************
To merge multiple projects
********************************
-Simply put all the video files of both projects into the "video" folder

-Copy all of the "projectmanifest.xml" files into the same project folder (let them have different names, just make sure they start with "projectmanifest"
